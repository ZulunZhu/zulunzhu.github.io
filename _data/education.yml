    During my time at Zhejiang University I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as as vice-president of street dance club, captain of the popping dance team, director of the university student union and national second-level basketball referee.
