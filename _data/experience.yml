    Design of loop closure of laser-based SLAM, code analysis, physical experiments and writing papers
    
    - Developed expert knowledge of overall architecture about ORB-SLAM2 and LOAM system and their code content, and the method design was carried out
    - Designed, wrote and debugged the code; completed the preliminary target of laser SLAM closed-loop detection; eﬀectively reduced the cumulative error
    - Made many KITTI data sets compatible with the system; completed the experimental test of the designed system, and eﬀectively corrected the accumulated error of the whole point cloud map
    - Assembled Husky intelligent robot; completed the construction of remote control system and the installation of sensing devices
    - Collected PCL point cloud data of campus environment; encapsulated the data and input it into the system to complete the physical experiment
